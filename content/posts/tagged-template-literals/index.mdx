# tagged-template-literals

I came across this subject today and hadn't heard of it before.

```js {7}
function highlight() {
    // do something
}

const name = 'Snickers';
const age = '100';
const sentence = highlight`My dog's name is ${name} and he is ${age} years old`;
console.log(sentence)
```
