I've recently started a new job as an Analyst Developer and suddenly, I was in the position to support many APIs.  There were SOAP and REST-based APIs.

So many questions:

- Why SOAP?
- Why did we move to REST for some?
- Why aren't we converting the SOAP to REST?
- Isn't graphQL a thing now?

In helping our third-party suppliers with their API questions, I found out the difference between them.

> SOAP - You can send an XML object to an endpoint that has some arguments about what you want.  I.e. date, api key, token, touring country, currency.

> REST - You do the same, but instead of XML, you use a JSON object

Anyway, I wanted to make them graphQL ready.  How? 

- Use the simplest API endpoint as a reference.
- Find out more on how they work (use the endpoints in a simple app)
- Find out the coding differences between the two. (Download the code ‚è© run up locally ‚è© find some (small) bugs or features in the backlog that is waiting for a dev to complete)
- Find out some DB info (which DB, connection info, where they getting info from (stored procs, functions, views))
- Map out the data visually

GraphQL queries the application, so find out how to do this on a .Net application

- [ ] - Find out which version of .Net we used

Next steps?

- [ ] - do a graphQL tutorial to spark some questions üî•
