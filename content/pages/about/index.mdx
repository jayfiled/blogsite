Hi!

I'm Joel.  I'm interested in everything.  My last 3 jobs - Japanese Speaking Tour Guide in Uluru, Technical ICT Support and Analyst Developer - all for the same travel company over 11 years.  My 3 _young_ kids keep me busy, but I am up at 5 am everyday coding, or learning something new.  I'd be totally down on spending that time helping you out on your project by contributing, doing casual work, or even being your rubber duck.
